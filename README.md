ScaleTail provides ready-to-run [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) stacks that instantly connect your self-hosted applications to your [Tailnet](https://tailscale.com/docs/concepts/tailnet). By using a Docker sidecar configuration, your applications get an [URL](https://grokipedia.com/page/URL) with automatic [HTTPS](https://grokipedia.com/page/HTTPS), for example: `https://application.tail-net.ts.net`.

## Quick Start

**Requirement:** *Docker Compose and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) must be installed. Preferably on a Linux operating system.*

1. **Get an Auth Key**  

   Go to the [Tailscale Admin Console → Keys](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys) and generate a new auth key.

2. **Clone and Choose a Service**

   Clone the repository and change directory to your desired service with the following command:

   ``` bash
   git clone https://github.com/tailscale-dev/ScaleTail.git
   cd ScaleTail/services/YourDesiredService 
   ```

3. **Configure and Launch**

   - Open the `.env` file in your chosen service directory.
   - Add your auth key after the line `TS_AUTHKEY=`.
   - Start the Docker compose stack:

   ``` bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

## Tailscale Information

### Tailscale Funnel vs. Tailscale Serve

Tailscale Funnel securely exposes services to the public internet. Tailscale Serve is for sharing content within a private Tailscale network (Tailnet). You'll need to decide how you want to expose the service, the configurations in this repository exposes the local Tailnet.

### Tailscale Funnel

[Tailscale Funnel](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel) is a feature that lets you route traffic from the internet to a local service running on a machine in your Tailscale network (known as a Tailnet). You can think of this as publicly sharing a local service, like a web app, for anyone to access—even if they don’t have Tailscale themselves.

### Tailscale Serve

[Tailscale Serve](https://tailscale.com/kb/1312/serve) is a feature that lets you route traffic from other devices on your Tailscale network (known as a Tailnet) to a local service running on your device. You can think of this as sharing the service, such as a website, with the rest of your Tailnet.
